```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  eval = FALSE
)
if (!knitr:::child_mode()) fig_path <- "figs"
```

## Log In

You can log into OpenAI's API running the dedicated `login()` function or just ask something with `askgpt()`:


```{r}
library(askgpt)
login()
#> ℹ It looks like you have not provided an API key yet. Let me guide you through the process:
#>   1. Go to <https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys>
#>   2. (Log into your account if you haven't done so yet)
#>   3. On the site, click the button + Create new secret key
#>   to create an API key
#>   4. Copy this key into R/RStudio
```

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Copy the API key from OpenAI's website"}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(fig_path, "key.png"))
```

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="And paste it into RStudio"}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(fig_path, "key-rs.png"))
```


You will not need to do this again after the first time.
(Technical detail: This will store an encrypted version of your key in the directory returned by `rappdirs::user_cache_dir("askgpt")`.)
If your old API key does not work any more, you can store a new one with: `login(force_refresh = TRUE)`.

## Usage

To enable error logging (which you need if you want askgpt to explain errors to you) first run:

```{r}
log_init()
```

After this, the key phrase **"What is wrong with my last command?"** (or just "help!") will make `askgpt` look up your last command and error message and return some help for you.
The other important key phrase is **"Can you elaborate on that?"** (or just "What?"), which will elaborate on the previous answer.
You can ask basically any question you want though:

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(askgpt)
log_init()

# Ask any question you like and get an answer in your Console
askgpt("What is an R function?")
askgpt("Can you help me with the function aes() from ggplot2?")

# this is a special trigger prompt that sends your last command to GPT
mean[1]
askgpt("What is wrong with my last command?")

askgpt("Can you elaborate on that?")
```

## Configure

You can configure how `askgpt` makes that start with `askgpt_*`.
For example, to use a different model to use in `askgpt()` use `options(askgpt_chat_model = "gpt-3.5-turbo-0301")` (or `options(askgpt_chat_model = "gpt-4")` if you have beta access to the newer model).
If you use the completions instead of the chat API (`chat = FALSE` in `askgpt()`) use `options(askgpt_completions_model = "text-curie-001")`.
It does not matter if the API parameter is listed in the function or not. 
All are used.
See the complete list [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat) and [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions).

The most important setting, however, is `askgpt_config`.
This can be used to configure the chat using plain English:

```{r}
options(askgpt_config = "I'm 8 years old, please explain things easily")
askgpt("What is an R function?")
#> 
#> ── Answer ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#> An R function is like giving your friend a set of instructions to perform a
#> particular task. In R programming, a function is a set of instructions or steps
#> that is given a name, and when you call that name, the function will perform
#> those instructions. A function can take information or inputs, do something
#> with those inputs (like adding or subtracting), and then give the result back
#> as output.
#> 
#> For example, think about giving your friend the instructions to make a peanut
#> butter sandwich. The instructions might be:
#> 
#> 1. Take two slices of bread 2. Spread peanut butter on one slice 3. Spread
#> jelly on the other slice 4. Put the two slices together
#> 
#> In R, a function might take a number (like 5) and add 1 to it, and then return
#> the result (which would be 6).
#> 
#> Functions in R are used to make code easier to use, understand, and reuse. They
#> can also help programmers write complex and efficient programs.
