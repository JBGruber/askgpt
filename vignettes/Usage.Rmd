knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  eval = FALSE
)
if (!knitr:::child_mode()) fig_path <- "figs"
```

## Log In

You can log into OpenAI's API running the dedicated `login()` function or just ask something with `askgpt()`:


```{r}
library(askgpt)
login()
#> â„¹ It looks like you have not provided an API key yet. Let me guide you through the process:
#>   1. Go to <https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys>
#>   2. (Log into your account if you haven't done so yet)
#>   3. On the site, click the button + Create new secret key
#>   to create an API key
#>   4. Copy this key into R/RStudio
```

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Copy the API key from OpenAI's website"}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(fig_path, "key.png"))
```

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="And paste it into RStudio"}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(fig_path, "key-rs.png"))
```


You will not need to do this again after the first time.
(Technical detail: This will store an encrypted version of your key in the directory returned by `rappdirs::user_cache_dir("askgpt")`.)
If your old API key does not work any more, you can store a new one with: `login(force_refresh = TRUE)`.

## Usage

To enable error logging (which you need if you want askgpt to explain errors to you) first run:

```{r}
log_init()
```

After this, the key phrase **"What is wrong with my last command?"** (or just "help!") will make `askgpt` look up your last command and error message and return some help for you.
The other important key phrase is **"Can you elaborate on that?"** (or just "What?"), which will elaborate on the previous answer.
You can ask basically any question you want though:

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(askgpt)
log_init()

# Ask any question you like and get an answer in your Console
askgpt("What is an R function?")
askgpt("Can you help me with the function aes() from ggplot2?")

# this is a special trigger prompt that sends your last command to GPT
mean[1]
askgpt("What is wrong with my last command?")

# the api does not really have a memory, the last prompt is sent to the API again
askgpt("Can you elaborate on that?")
```
