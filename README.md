The goal of askgpt is to help you to learn R, using a ChatGPT-like
prompt and answer system. It sends prompts to [openai‚Äôs
API](https://openai.com/api/) directly from R. It also has some
additional functionality:

- Prompt ‚ÄúWhat is wrong with my last command?‚Äù (or ‚Äúhelp!‚Äù) to get help
  on the last error R emmitted
- Prompt ‚ÄúCan you elaborate on that?‚Äù (or ‚Äúwhat?‚Äù) to ask GPT to
  elaborate on the last reply
- Use the RStudio addin to comment, annotate or explain highlighted code

## Installation

You can install the development version of askgpt like so:

``` r
remotes::install_github("JBGruber/askgpt")
```

``` r
library(askgpt)
#> ‚Ñπ Hi, this is askgpt ‚ò∫.
#> ‚Ä¢ To start error logging, run ]8;;ide:run:askgpt::log_init()`log_init()`]8;; now.
#> ‚Ä¢ To see what you can do use ]8;;ide:help:askgpt::askgpt`?askgpt()`]8;;.
#> ‚Ä¢ Or just run ]8;;ide:run:askgpt::askgpt()`askgpt()`]8;; with any question you want!
```

## Log In

You can log into the OpenAI‚Äôs API running the dedicated `login()`
function or just ask something with `askgpt()`:

``` r
login()
#> ‚Ñπ It looks like you have not provided an API key yet. Let me guide you through the process:
#>   1. Go to <https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys>
#>   2. (Log into your account if you haven't done so yet)
#>   3. On the site, click the button + Create new secret key
#>   to create an API key
#>   4. Copy this key into R/RStudio
```

You will not need to do this again after the first time. (Technical
detail: This will store an encrypted version of your key in the
directory returned by `rappdirs::user_cache_dir("askgpt")`.) If your old
API key does not work any more, you can store a new one with:
`login(force_refresh = TRUE)`.

## Usage

To enable error logging (which you need if you want askgpt to explain
errors to you) first run:

``` r
log_init()
```

After this, the key phrase **‚ÄúWhat is wrong with my last command?‚Äù** (or
just ‚Äúhelp!‚Äù) will make `askgpt` look up your last command and error
message and return some help for you. The other important key phrase is
**‚ÄúCan you elaborate on that?‚Äù** (or just ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù), which will elaborate
on the last answer you have gotten. You can ask basically any question
you want though:
