You're new to R?
You don't quite understand the code you copied from that tutorial?
You get error messages that make no sense to you?
Don't worry, just *askgpt*!

`askgpt` is basically ChatGPT but from R (technically, it sends prompts to [OpenAI's API](https://openai.com/api/) directly from R).
It also has some additional functionality:

- Prompt *"What is wrong with my last command?"* (or *"help!"*) to get help on the last error R emitted
- Use the RStudio addin to comment, annotate or explain highlighted code

See more under [Usage](#usage).

## Installation

You can install release version of askgpt like so:

``` r
install.packages("askgpt")
```

You can install the development version of askgpt like so:

``` r
remotes::install_github("JBGruber/askgpt")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
fig_path = "vignettes/figs"
res <- knitr::knit_child("vignettes/Usage.Rmd", quiet = TRUE)
cat(res, sep = '\n')
```
